Yet another 2D C++ game framework.

## Third Party

I'm using a few third-party libraries to make my life easier. But someday I will remove them. But now I'm using:

| Name           | Purpose                   |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| SDL            | Window and Input handling |
| glad           | OpenGL loading            |
| stb            | Image loading             |
| nlohmann::json | JSON parsing              |
